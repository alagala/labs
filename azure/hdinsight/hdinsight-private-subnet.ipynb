    "\n",
    "Each HDInsight cluster deployed in a virtual network has a private endpoint in the form of **https://CLUSTERNAME-int.azurehdinsight.net** as well as a public endpoint. Note the **“-int”** in this URL, this endpoint will resolve to a private IP in that virtual network and is not accessible from the public Internet.\n",
